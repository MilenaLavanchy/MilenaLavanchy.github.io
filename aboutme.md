subtitle: My place is where my heart belongs to and I'm excited to explore its lands and waters :)

Things which make me happy, that I can spend hours doing:
* exploring the diversity of functional areas, thus, fostering a higher degree of technical and functional versatility, while refining a sense of relationship.
* comparing, contrasting, and combining creative ideas to develop insights and alternative possibilities

My main areas of interests are product design of community application and data privacy and inovantion. I have experience in Application Development, Requirement management and Conceptual Modeling as well.

Also, I'd like to share with you my interests in the use of free software.

Moreover I am particularly interested in development of my public speaking skills at Toastmasters.

And last but not least some other areas I am interested in like philosophy of mind, conceptual art, writing and music, dance, regulation of emotional expression, and felines :)
