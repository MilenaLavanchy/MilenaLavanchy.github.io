title: Milena's Set of Elements - Open source, gender-diversity and habits formation in every workplace in my pathway
---
As a woman working in IT, I have found throughout my career a profound absence of gender diversity. I have always asked myself what can I do to contribute to making the sector more open to women and other under-represented groups. By increasing the number of women in this sector, this will create a broader basis of perspectives, and have the potential to raise resilience through having a wider spectrum of talents and capabilities responding to challenges.

I have been working as a software developer. However my approach concerning IT is wider than straight programming. I have always tried to understand IT in a creative and social/cultural context, while improving organisational structure to support new ideas and experiences. This is what I would call my dream job.  

Recently, I have been intrigued by Charles Duhigg’s writing, which describes how habit formation could reflect, reinforce or hinders the development of perception skills. What I mean by perception skills is our abilities to perceive and understand what is around us. He concluded that if the ability to contribute at individual level is compromised in any way, this will affect inevitably the community as well.

Being involved in an open source project gives me great pride, and I believe that an open source approach offers a great potential for improving the challenges we face today in relation to this issue. I participated recently as a mentor in a project titled ‘Free Software Habits’ for the Google Summer of Code project under Debian Umbrella. My engagement in this project was pleasing in various ways. The intention was to foster the development of a plugin which help you to contribute, and to support habits formation in open source engagement. The goal as described in GSoC project proposal by Daniel Pocock for the 2018 edition, is to create more awareness of existing free software, highlight alternatives that otherwise wouldn't be known by the user and change habits into using free software. Additionally, the plugin was developed by Enkelena Haxhija, a very nice example of the kind of young women who we wish to see more engaged in the IT sector.

This project was followed by the Google Summer of Code Mentors Summit in Silicon Valley. During my time as a participant there, I was motivated by their commitment to the importance of gender diversity in the IT projects. There I had the privilege to propose, organise and conduct a session titled ‘Improving diversity in my project’. During the discussions in the session we shared our experiences, and it was a wonderful opportunity to engage in self-reflection and to learn from the experiences of the other participants. The discussion with Software Freedom Conservany projects attendees and the chance to met Molly de Blanc. Karen Sandler and Joshua Bloch pushed me forward to deepen my understanding of the Copyright  Aggregation Project.

Thus, I needed to know more about the typical context and specificity of open source projects. Someone once said, “A map is not the territory it represents, but if correct, it has a similar structure to the territory, which accounts for its usefulness” (Korzybski, 1933, 751).  The richness and density of the discussion I had with Asheesh Laroia allowed us to discuss some of most challending questions about the defence of software freedom and helped me to understand better the motivations behind them and where they are heading. That's why I was so delighted to meet Asheesh.

During my stay in the US, I met people and made connections at very interesting events. 

I had the opportunity to participate in the Bay Area Debian annual meeting. I appreciated very much the wide range of topics discussed there such as the benefits and the challenges of the cultural diversity in workplace, as well as the importance of valuing this cultural diversity.

There, I attended the Toastmasters of Mountain View. There's so much knowledge to be gained from such a terrific group with a wide variety of perspectives. It was the most valuable way for me to spend that Monday evening.

I had the fabulous chance to attend The Stanford Storytelling Meeting, an arts program at Stanford University about how storytelling can potentially hugely deepen ours lives. I had a wonderful time where I could deepen my understanding of past experiences, while being inspired by every story shared there.

In Palo Alto, I attended a co-working day for women entrepreneurs and technologists which takes place regularly at a co-working space in Palo Alto as part of a growing, global trend of the increasing number of co-working spaces, facilities that serve as a space for group work. This event brings attention to the women who are gifting the community with their talents and capabilities, sharing their creative force to create the change in the systems they desire to see.

I was lucky enough to be in Palo Alto while the Timmy Awards was on. I was pleased to discuss with women who were finalists, yet another example to consider in our gender-diversity challenges.

At the same event, impassioned by the way NASA value the benefits that result from a diversity of perspectives, I was delighted to discuss with the NASA attendees the further potential uses of open source in facilitating wider participation.

The inner low murmur “But you’re a girl” has never entirely disappeared. Facts on the ground prove that the gender gap remains today a significant challenge. And to tackling this challenge depends on the further efforts of everyone of us.
